# Restaurant

My response to the Odin Project JavaScript course challenge (specification available here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) This is a single page website for a fictional restaurant, built using mainly Vanilla JS but with Webpacker for bundling and installing.

This was an exercise in practicing:

- Design and CSS.
- 'Routing' using JavaScript on a SPA without a real framework.
- Configuring and using Webpack to bundle JS/CSS to the site, enabling the use of modules.
